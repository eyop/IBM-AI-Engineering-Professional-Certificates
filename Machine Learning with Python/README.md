# Machine Learning With Pythonâœ¨
Machine learning (ML) is the practice of teaching a computer to learn and it is a type of artificial intelligence that extract patterns out of raw data by using an algorithm or method. The main focus of ML is to allow computer systems learn from experience without being explicitly programmed or human intervention.
## ðŸ“„ Summary

This course provides a gentle introduction to ML and what it is, with topics like supervised vs. unsupervised learning, classification, regression, and clustering technique with Python libraries like SciPy and scikit-learn. It then covers topics such as model evaluation.

The final project within this course is the building of a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off. It is a classification problem, and KNN, Decision Tree, SVM, and Logistic Regression are all used to determine the best algorithm to use.
